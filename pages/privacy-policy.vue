                  Outside of the situations mentioned in this Privacy Policy, we

                  Sometimes it is necessary to share your personal data with third
                  parties. Depending on the circumstances of the case, this may be
                  necessary in order to handle your file. There are also statutory
                  obligations which mean that personal data must be passed on to
                  third parties.

                <p>

                      When handling a file, it may be necessary to share your

                      against another party, concluding a contract or for a notarial
                      deed involving several parties.
