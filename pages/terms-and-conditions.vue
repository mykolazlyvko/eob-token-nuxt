                      The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile,
                      subjective and have noninherent or intrinsic value.
                      Fluctuations in the price of other Digital Assets could
                      materially and adversely affect the Digital Assets, which may also be
                      subject to significant price volatility. In addition, a lack
                      of use or public interest in Digital Assets could negatively impact the
                      potential utility or value of Digital Assets. Each Digital Asset has no inherent
                      or intrinsic value. There is no guarantee that any purchases
                      of Digital Assets will retain their original value, as their value is
                      inherently subjective and factors occurring outside of the
                      platform(s) related to the Digital Assets may materially impact the
                      value and desirability of any particular Digital Asset.

                    <p>
                      Given the volatility, Digital Assets should not be considered an
                      investment. You assume all risks in that connection.

                      A royalty or secondary sale fee can be applied when You sell
                      Digital Assets on the secondary markets for other Digital Assets. To the extent
                      possible, We apply a royalty of 10% on each re-sell.
